Recently I was working with a client to train their internal teams on how to build web applications. During this process it occurred to me that the way we presently architect the front-end is very strange and even a bit broken. In many instances you’re either copying huge chunks of HTML out of some doc and then pasting that into your app (Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.), or you’re sprinkling the page with jQuery plugins which have to be configured using JavaScript . It puts us in the rather unfortunate position of having to choose between bloated HTML or mysterious HTML, and often we choose both.
